Data Collection: 
I went to developer settings, generated a GitHub PAT using my student Gmail, and used it in a Python script requiring authorization token to fetch and store user and repository data into CSV files : users.csv ; and repositories.csv


Interesting Finding: 
Developers with longer bios appear to have more followers, suggesting profile detail may impact follower count.


Recommendation: 
Developers can grow their network by crafting detailed, engaging bios to increase visibility and follower growth on GitHub.
